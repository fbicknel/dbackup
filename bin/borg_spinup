# Setting this, so the repo does not need to be given on the commandline:
# export BORG_REPO=ssh://username@example.com:2022/~/backup/main
export BORG_REPO='/mnt/backup/borgbackup'
export BORG_CACHE_DIR='/root/.cache/borg'
export BORG_CONFIG_DIR='/root/.config/borg'
export BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL=64

# Setting this, so you won't be asked for your repository passphrase:
# export BORG_PASSPHRASE='no, we don't use this'
# or this to ask an external program to supply the passphrase:
export BORG_PASSCOMMAND='cat /root/.passwords/borgbackup-prod'
